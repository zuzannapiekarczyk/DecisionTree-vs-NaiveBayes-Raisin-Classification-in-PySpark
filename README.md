# DecisionTree-vs-NaiveBayes-Raisin-Classification-in-PySpark

## Project Overview

This project compares the effectiveness of two popular classification methods: decision trees and naive Bayes classifier. The analysis focuses on their theoretical foundations, practical applications, and efficiency in classifying raisin varieties.

The project includes:

- Detailed discussion of the assumptions and construction of models for both classification methods.
- Implementation of methods in a programming environment, including machine learning libraries.
- Classification of data on a test set.
- Evaluation of the effectiveness of each method based on measures such as classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc.
- Comparison of results and drawing conclusions regarding the effectiveness and applications of both classification methods.

## Data:

The dataset comes from a scientific article and includes samples of two raisin varieties: Besni and Kecimen. They were collected by gathering raisin seed samples, captured in digital images ready for analysis using machine vision system. The dataset contains information such as area, perimeter, major and minor axis length, eccentricity, convex area, and extent.

Feel free to explore the code, adapt it to different datasets, and experiment with various parameters to enhance model performance. Happy exploring!
